The 29-year-old Mexican national, now living in Austin, claims store managers mocked her when she tried to speak English and threatened to fire her if she spoke Spanish.\\n\\nRodriguez said managers at the Austin store later told her speaking Spanish was &quot;offensive&quot; to customers unless they first spoke to her in that language. Spanish is Rodriguez&#x27;s native language.\\n\\nAlbertsons spokesman Michael Read said he has not seen the lawsuit and would not comment on the allegations. However, he said there is no companywide policy that prohibits employees from speaking Spanish to customers.\\n\\n&quot;If we have an employee base that can address their own customers in their own language, that often helps us address customers better,&quot; Read said.\\n\\nRodriguez said she was verbally abused by two managers over a 6-month period.\\n\\nand that one told her Mexicans only come to the United States &quot;for the welfare or for the food stamps.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;I said, &#x27;Excuse me, I stay here for 10 years and never use food stamps,&quot;&#x27; Rodriguez said, speaking in Spanish.\\n\\nRodriguez&#x27;s lawsuit was filed Aug. 9 in District Court in Travis County. Tuesday&#x27;s news conference was set up by the League of United Latin American Citizens.\\n\\n, which said it would probably join the lawsuit.\\n\\nAlbertsons is the nation&#x27;s second largest grocery store chain, with about $37 billion in annual revenues and 2,500 stores in 37 states, including 219 in Texas. In much of its advertising, the chain has become known for the slogan &quot;Albertsons, it&#x27;s your store.&quot;\\n\\nGil Gamez of LULAC said the incident shows that Albertsons has allowed a corporate culture of non-acceptance to exist; he also doubts Rodriguez&#x27;s accusations are an isolated incident.\\n14:22:27 - Guest33006229: I want to cite as Rodriguez v.

I am not sure why that link was not working. What I did figure out is that we do not subscribe to that one directly through the publisher, and the Academic One File access says it is to the present but there is actually a delay before the articles are put into Academic One File. It looks like they currently have through 2014. The one you want is from 2015 so you would have to put in an interlibrary loan request as mentioned above.\\n',\n"," '15:12:52 - Info Desk: Hi, welcome to the Rod Library Ask Us service.

I tried to do what the tutorial showed me to do to allow pop-ups, but the system did not give me that option from the drop down menu. Perhaps I should use Firefox rather than Chrome.
