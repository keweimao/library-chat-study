Welcome to Phase 1 of the chat analysis which pre-processes a raw chat data .csv file 
from the LibChat keeping only the 5 columns (with column-headings): 
Timestamp, Duration (seconds), Initial Question, Message Count, and Transcript. 

Running Phase 1 to pre-process your raw chat data (.csv) will generate four cleaned chat 
files varying the parts of speech or question-only. 
1) "onlyQuestionsFile.txt" - consists of only the initial questions asked by the library patrons 
2) "wholeChatsFile.txt" - consists of the whole cleaned chat transcripts 
3) "wholeChatsFilePOS_N_ADJ.txt" - consists of only the nouns and adjectives parts-of-speech (POS) 
4) "wholeChatsFilePOS_N_ADJ_V.txt" - consists of only the nouns, adjectives, and verbs parts-of-speech


Step 1. Please input the raw LibChat (.csv) file.
(For example: "chatFile.csv"): original_without_identifiable_info_chat_transcripts_9942_041015_053119.csv

Step 2. Please input the stop words (.txt) file.
(For example: "stop_words.txt"): stop_words.txt


WARNING:  Depending on the size of your chat data file.  This step might take several minutes.
Number of initial questions from Initial Question column of .csv: 1062
Total Question Count: 8852 written to onlyQuestionsFile.txt
Whole Chats Count: 9146 written to wholeChatsFile.txt
Whole Chats Count: 9146 written to wholeChatsFilePOS_N_ADJ.txt
Whole Chats Count: 9146 written to wholeChatsFilePOS_N_ADJ_V.txt
